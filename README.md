Monitoring and control software tool

This is the rebase of the original Tool. Goal is to have EVERYTHING be absolutely dynamic. This means the following:
1) Dynamic COM Port device detection
2) Dynamic number of sensors 
3) Dynamic TYPE of sensors

Long story short....a fully dynamic tool for the user to just have it plug 'n play.
